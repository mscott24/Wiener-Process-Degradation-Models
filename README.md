# Wiener-Process-Degradation-Models
Run a Wiener process degradation model (WPDM) using first difference estimators. These functions were used in the manuscript "Assessment of Wiener Processes Degradation Models with Application to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Decline". The user can run this class of models with: 
- Direct optimization of the likelihood through L-BFGS
- Profile likelihood methods with maximum likelihood or empirically unbiased estimators

As an implementation example, please refer to sample code.R. For additional details, review the documentation in the primary function WPDM.R.
